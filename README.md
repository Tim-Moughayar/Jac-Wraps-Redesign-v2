# Jac Wraps Website Redesign
*A website redesign for my web development college courses.* <br><br> 

I made the initial design back in November 2023 for my Web UX Fundementals and Prototyping class. 
That same semester, I used the design to create a website for my Web Development class.
I redid my design and website after completing a Web development Bootcamp in August 2024. This current design and website is still under development.
