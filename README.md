# Jac Wraps Website Redesign
A website redesign for Jac Wraps for web development courses. I made the initial design back in November 2023 for my Web UX Fundementals and Prototyping class. 
That same semester, I used the design to create a website for my final exam of my Web Development class. 
I redid my design and website after taking a Web development Bootcamp in July 2024. This current design and website is still in development.
